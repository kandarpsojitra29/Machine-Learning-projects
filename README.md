# Machine-Learning-projects
This repository contains homework problems and their solutions from the Machine Learning course I completed.

Homework Topics:
* `Linear_and_Logistic_Regression`: Linear and Logistic Regression model
* `tree_based_modl`: Tree-based model
* `SVM`: Support Vector Machine model
* `CNN`: Convolutional Neural Network model (MNIST Dataset)
  
Project:
* Predicting meal caloric content by integrating Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) data, Food images, Anthropometric data, and Gut microbiome information
* A transformer-based model was utilized for this project
